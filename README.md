# BBTR

Source code for [bbtr.fr](https://bbtr.fr).

Relevant documentation:
- The Static Site Generator: [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
- Our theme is [Material for Mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)
    - (note that the theme does almost more than the base framework in terms
      of what the website does, how it works etc. If you need anything, it's
      most likely there)
    - See the [config](mkdocs.yml) page, there are some comments here for
      some specific features
- [Cloudflare pages](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/)
    - In particular, if you submit a PR, you should get a link to a domain
      where you can preview your changes
